Users of dating websites expect their profiles on these sites to be anonymous.
We conjecture that many users reuse photos from non-anonymous social networks, such as Facebook, when creating their profiles on dating websites.
We exploit this fact to show a simple method for linking dating profile the profiles.
Specifically, this work introduces a virtually undetectable method for extracting profile information from social networks and dating websites, and a deceptively simple method for matching profile photos across two data sets for the purposes of identifying users on supposedly-anonymous networks.

% QUICK OUTLINE

% Privacy expectation vs reality.
% What to do in order to educate users?

% Technical nugget:

% impersonating users for crawling: chrome debug console to impersonate a user session. Instead of imitating a browser session, we simply instrument one to pro grammatically simulate user input (remote debugging interface for Chromium / Google Chrome).
% Story: sites employ complex countermeasures, while users are not protected from a simple technique. TODO: timing?

% unbreakable in much the same way as screen manipulation, but also have access to DOM structure.

% Secondary:

% Observation that profile photos are taken from a pool of a users ``best'' profile photographs - an often small pool. As a result, a user often reuses the same photographs 
% image similarity, phash. Limitiations. Future work.
